### Modding and Linking Exceptions

This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3). To facilitate its use within the modding community and its integration with proprietary software and libraries under different licenses, the following exceptions apply:
1. Modding Exception

This project is intended to be used with and modify existing software (referred to as the "Modded Code") to support the modding community.
Additional Permission:

As a special exception, the authors grant you the additional right to link the code of this project with the Modded Code and to distribute combined works. This exception ensures that:

    The Modded Code (e.g., Skyrim or similar proprietary software) does not become subject to the GNU General Public License solely due to its interaction with this project.
    The Modded Code retains its original license.

Limitations:

This exception only applies to the Modded Code. All other code combined with this project must comply with the terms of the GNU General Public License v3.0.

If you modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version of the file, but you are not required to do so. If you choose not to provide this exception, you must remove this exception statement and license the file solely under GPLv3.
2. GPL-3.0 Linking Exception (with Corresponding Source)

To ensure compatibility with commonly used modding libraries under different licenses, the authors grant additional permission to link this project with libraries (referred to as "Modding Libraries") under licenses that may not be fully GPLv3-compatible.
Additional Permission:

If you modify this project or create a combined work by linking it with Modding Libraries (or modified versions thereof), you are granted additional permission to distribute the resulting work, provided that:

    The source code for the Modding Libraries used is included or made available along with the source code of this project.
    You comply with the terms of the GPLv3 for all parts of the work that are not covered by this exception.

Examples:

This exception allows the use of:

    libsndfile (licensed under LGPL-2.1)
    Other modding-related libraries that may not be directly GPLv3-compatible.

Purpose of the Exceptions

These exceptions are designed to:

    Support a thriving modding community by ensuring compatibility with proprietary software (e.g., Skyrim).
    Allow the integration of libraries with different licenses that are widely used within the modding ecosystem.
    Preserve the freedom and open-source nature of this project while minimizing legal and licensing barriers.

If you have questions about these exceptions, please refer to the project's license or contact the project maintainers.
